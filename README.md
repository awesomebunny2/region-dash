# region-dash README

The region-dash extension is simple. When run, - characters will be inserted into your code from the point of your curser up to column 151 (where my currrent guide is). If this every changes, I'll need to go into the settings and update the number from 150 ( always 1 less than output) to the new column number. Just run it by clicking CMD + SHIFT + P to open the VSCode command prompt and search for "dash". Set a keyboard shortcut for it by going to Preferences and then Keyboard Shortcuts. Search for "dash" and then enter in the desired shortcut. I used CMD + SHIFT + -. I had to update one of the Zoom Out shortcuts from the same thing to jjst CMD + -.

## Features

Since this is inly going to be used by me and possibly some close friends, I have nothing further to say.

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

None as far as I'm aware.

## Extension Settings

No settings are updated or adjusted. Just a simple extnesion that adds dynamic characters.

## Known Issues

Could be more comprensive in the future if I want to really figure out the vscode API. But for now, it works for something I threw together in 45 minutes.

## Release Notes

Fine. Here's the current release:

### 1.0.1
Guess I lied. I forgot to turn off the "Hello World!" message that is sent to the user when the script is run. I also commented out all the console.logs. Should be no need for further updates.

### 1.0.0

Initial release of region-dash. Unlikely that there will be anymore. Sorry.
